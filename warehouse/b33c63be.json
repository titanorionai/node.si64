    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test. However, I want to clarify that I'll need more context or information about what kind of stress test you're referring to (e.g., financial, physical, mental). If you could provide more details, I'd be better equipped to assist you.\n\nIf you meant a cognitive stress test, I can simulate one with you. Please keep in mind that this won't be an actual clinical assessment, but rather a fun and interactive way to challenge your brain.\n\nHere's how we can proceed:\n\n1. I'll give you a series of tasks or questions that will push your cognitive abilities.\n2. You'll try to complete each task as efficiently and accurately as possible.\n3. We'll see how well you perform under pressure!\n\nReady to get started? Here's your first task:\n\n**Task 1: Math Problem Solving**\n\nI'll give you a series of math problems, and you need to solve them within a certain time limit (e.g., 30 seconds). The twist is that I'll introduce \"distractions\" (e.g., unrelated questions or sounds) during the test.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"
