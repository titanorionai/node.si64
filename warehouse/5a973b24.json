Please note that I'll do my best to simulate a stressful conversation, but don't worry, it's all just for fun.\n\nHere's how we can proceed:\n\n* I'll start by asking you a series of questions or giving you a scenario to respond to.\n* The questions will become increasingly difficult and challenging as the test progresses.\n* Your goal is to think on your feet and come up with creative solutions to each problem.\n* If you need help or clarification, just let me know!\n\nReady to begin? Here's your first challenge:\n\n**Stress Test #27: The Unexpected Customer**\n\nYou're working as a customer service representative for a retail company. Suddenly, the phone rings, and it's a very upset customer on the other end.\n\n\"Hello? I need to speak to someone about my order,\" the customer says. \"I've been waiting for two weeks, and it still hasn't arrived. This is ridiculous!\"\n\nWhat do you say in response?\n\n(Remember, think on your feet!)"
