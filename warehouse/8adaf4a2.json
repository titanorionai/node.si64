A financial stress test (e.g., a mortgage or investment product)?\n2. A cognitive stress test (e.g., memory or attention tests)?\n3. A performance stress test (e.g., software or system testing)?\n\nOr is it something else?\n\nPlease provide more context or clarify which type of stress test you'd like to simulate, and I'll do my best to assist you!"
