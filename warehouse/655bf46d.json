    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test! However, I need more information from you. What kind of stress test are you referring to? Are you looking for a performance benchmarking test or a simulation tool?\n\nHere are a few options:\n\n1. **Web application stress testing**: If you're testing a web application, I can simulate a large number of users and requests to see how your application performs under load.\n2. **Network stress testing**: If you're interested in testing network connectivity or performance, I can simulate a high volume of network traffic to see how your system responds.\n3. **System stress testing**: If you want to test the stability and performance of a specific system (e.g., CPU, memory, disk), I can provide guidance on how to conduct a stress test.\n\nPlease let me know which type of stress test you're interested in, and I'll do my best to assist you!"
