    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test. What kind of stress test are you referring to? Are you looking for a:\n\n1. Financial stress test (e.g., evaluating the impact of economic downturns on your investments or financial stability)?\n2. Physical stress test (e.g., assessing your body's response to exercise or physical activity)?\n3. Mental health stress test (e.g., evaluating your ability to cope with anxiety, depression, or other mental health challenges)?\n4. Cognitive stress test (e.g., assessing your ability to perform complex tasks under pressure)?\n\nPlease let me know which type of stress test you're interested in, and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nIf you're looking for a general stress test to gauge your overall well-being, I can offer some suggestions:\n\n* Take a short physical exercise break (e.g., 10-15 minutes of light cardio or stretching)\n* Try a brief mental challenge (e.g., solving a complex puzzle or brain teaser)\n* Engage in a conversation with someone new or on a different topic\n* Practice deep breathing exercises or meditation for a few minutes\n\nKeep in mind that these are just suggestions, and it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional if you're experiencing stress or anxiety.\n\nWhich option sounds appealing to you, or do you have something specific in mind?"
