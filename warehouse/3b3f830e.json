    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test. What kind of stress test are you looking for? Here are some options:\n\n1. **Financial Stress Test**: I can generate a scenario-based financial stress test, where we'll simulate different economic conditions and see how your investments or savings perform.\n2. **Cognitive Stress Test**: We can conduct a cognitive stress test to assess your ability to focus, think critically, and make quick decisions under pressure.\n3. **Physical Stress Test**: If you're looking for a more traditional physical stress test, I can guide you through a series of exercises to simulate different types of physical stress (e.g., endurance, strength, agility).\n4. **Emotional Stress Test**: We can explore how you handle emotional stress by discussing scenarios that might trigger feelings of anxiety, frustration, or overwhelm.\n\nWhich type of stress test are you interested in? Or do you have a specific area in mind?"
