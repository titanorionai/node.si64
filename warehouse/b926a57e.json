    "response": "It seems like you're referring to a specific stress testing scenario. However, I need more information about what kind of system or application you want to simulate for the stress test. Could you please provide some details?\n\nHere are a few questions to help me narrow down the scope:\n\n1. What type of system are we testing (e.g., web server, database, network, etc.)?\n2. What are the expected load or usage patterns during the stress test?\n3. Are there any specific performance metrics or scenarios you'd like to focus on?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your requirements, I'll do my best to assist you with creating a stress testing scenario for #141!"
