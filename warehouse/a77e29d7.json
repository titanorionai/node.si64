Are you looking for a physical exercise stress test, such as an ECG or treadmill test?\n\nOr perhaps you're referring to a software stress test, where we simulate heavy loads on a system or application to assess its performance and stability under pressure?\n\nOr maybe it's something else entirely? Could you please provide more context or clarify what you mean by \"stress test #26\"? I'm here to help!"
