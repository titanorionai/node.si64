    "response": "I'd be happy to help with a stress test, but I need to know what kind of stress test you're referring to. Are you looking for:\n\n1. A coding challenge?\n2. A problem-solving exercise?\n3. A game or puzzle?\n\nPlease provide more context or information about the type of stress test you have in mind, and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nIf you're ready to move forward with a general stress test, here's an example:\n\n**Stress Test #10: Logic Puzzle**\n\nYou are given five houses, each painted a different color (blue, green, red, white, and yellow), and each occupied by a person of a different nationality (American, British, Canadian, Indian, and Japanese). Each person has a different favorite drink (coffee, tea, milk, soda, and water). Using the following clues, can you determine the color of each house, the nationality of its occupant, and their favorite drink?\n\n* The Canadian lives in the first house.\n* The person who owns the yellow house drinks soda.\n* The British person lives in the red house.\n* The person who drinks coffee lives in the house next to the green house.\n* The American lives in the house next to the person who drinks milk.\n\nWhat's your solution?"
