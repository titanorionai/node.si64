Stress testing in finance and economics?\n2. Stress testing in cybersecurity?\n3. Stress testing in performance or benchmarking?\n4. Something else?\n\nPlease provide more context or clarify which type of stress test you're interested in, and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nIf you meant a specific type of stress test (e.g., FinSim, Monte Carlo simulation), please let me know, and I can try to help with that as well."
