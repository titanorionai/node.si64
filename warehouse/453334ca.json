    "response": "I'd be happy to help with a stress test. What kind of stress test are you referring to? Are you looking for a mental or physical stress test?\n\nIf it's a mental stress test, I can offer you a series of questions or scenarios designed to simulate real-life stressors and challenge your problem-solving skills.\n\nIf it's a physical stress test, I can provide you with some exercises or activities that are intended to test your endurance and stamina. However, please note that I'm not a medical professional, and any physical activity should be discussed and approved by a qualified healthcare expert.\n\nPlease let me know which type of stress test you're interested in, and we can get started!"
