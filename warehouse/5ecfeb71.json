    "response": "I'm happy to help you with a stress test, but I need more information about what kind of stress test you're referring to. Are you looking for a financial stress test, a psychological stress test, or something else?\n\nIf you're referring to a software stress test, I can try to simulate some common scenarios that might put your system under pressure. Please provide me with some details about the system you want to test, such as:\n\n* What is the system doing (e.g., processing data, handling requests)?\n* What are the expected inputs and outputs?\n* Are there any specific resources or components that should be stressed (e.g., CPU, memory, network)?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of what you're looking for, I can try to simulate some stress test scenarios and provide you with feedback on how your system performs under pressure."
