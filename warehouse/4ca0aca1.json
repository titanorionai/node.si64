    "response": "I'd be happy to help with a stress test. However, I need to clarify what kind of stress test you're referring to.\n\nHere are a few options:\n\n1. **Financial stress test**: This type of test evaluates an individual's or organization's ability to withstand financial shocks, such as job loss, medical emergencies, or market downturns.\n2. **Physical stress test**: Also known as a physical exertion test, this measures the body's response to physical activity, such as exercise or athletic competition.\n3. **Mental stress test**: This type of test assesses an individual's ability to cope with mental challenges, such as high levels of anxiety, depression, or emotional distress.\n\nPlease let me know which type of stress test you're interested in, and I'll do my best to provide a simulated exercise to help you prepare."
