    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test! However, I need to clarify that I don't have any specific information about what kind of stress test you're referring to. Are you looking for a cognitive stress test, a physical stress test, or something else?\n\nIf you're looking for a cognitive stress test, I can provide you with some examples:\n\n1. **Stroop Test**: A classic task that requires participants to identify the color of a word (e.g., \"red\" written in blue ink).\n2. **Flanker Task**: A visual attention task where participants have to respond to targets while ignoring distractors.\n3. **N-back Task**: A working memory task where participants have to identify when a stimulus matches the one presented a certain number of trials ago.\n\nIf you're looking for a physical stress test, I can provide information on:\n\n1. **Cardiovascular Stress Test**: A medical test used to evaluate cardiovascular function and detect potential heart problems.\n2. **Orthostatic Stress Test**: A test that evaluates the body's response to changes in blood pressure when standing up.\n\nOr if you have something else in mind, please let me know and I'll do my best to help!"
