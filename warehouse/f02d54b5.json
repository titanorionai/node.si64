    "response": "I'd be happy to help with a stress test. What kind of stress test are you referring to? Are you looking for a:\n\n1. Physical stress test (e.g., cardiovascular stress test)?\n2. Mental or emotional stress test?\n3. Software stress testing (e.g., load testing, performance testing)?\n4. Something else?\n\nPlease provide more context or information about the type of stress test you're interested in, and I'll do my best to help.\n\nIf you'd like, I can also suggest some general stress test ideas for a hypothetical scenario:\n\n1. **Financial stress test**: Imagine you've just received news that your investments have lost 50% of their value overnight. How would you manage your finances?\n2. **Relationship stress test**: Suppose you're in a long-term relationship and discover that your partner is planning to leave you. How would you cope with the emotional strain?\n3. **Workplace stress test**: Imagine you're facing an impossible deadline at work, and your boss is breathing down your neck. How would you manage your workload?\n\nPlease feel free to choose one of these scenarios or provide a different context for our stress test. I'll do my best to help!"
