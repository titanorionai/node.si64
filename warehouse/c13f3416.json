Physical exercise or endurance test?\n\nPlease provide more context so I can better understand your request and provide a helpful response.\n\nIf you're interested in a fun stress test, I can suggest some popular ones like:\n\n* A 10-minute writing sprint\n* A 30-day fitness challenge\n* A coding challenge with a limited amount of time to complete\n\nLet me know if any of these options sound interesting or if you have something else in mind!"
