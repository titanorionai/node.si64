Here are some options:\n\n1. **Code stress testing**: Provide me with a piece of code, and I can try to identify potential performance bottlenecks or areas for optimization.\n2. **Web application stress testing**: Describe the web application you'd like me to test (e.g., e-commerce site, login system), and I can simulate a load of users accessing it simultaneously.\n3. **Mathematical stress testing**: Provide me with a mathematical problem or equation, and I can try to solve it under increasing levels of difficulty or complexity.\n\nWhich option would you like to choose?"
