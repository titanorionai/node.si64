    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test! Since I don't have any specific information about what kind of stress test you're referring to (e.g., financial, cognitive, etc.), I'll provide a general response.\n\nA stress test is a simulation or exercise designed to evaluate an individual's or organization's ability to perform under intense pressure or uncertainty. Here are some possible types of stress tests:\n\n1. **Financial stress test**: A test that evaluates an investor's or institution's financial stability and resilience in the face of various economic scenarios, such as market downturns or interest rate changes.\n2. **Cognitive stress test**: A test that assesses an individual's mental performance under conditions of high pressure, fatigue, or distraction, often used in employment screening or cognitive assessment.\n3. **Operational stress test**: A test that evaluates an organization's ability to manage and respond to unexpected events or disruptions, such as natural disasters, cyber attacks, or supply chain issues.\n\nTo perform a stress test, I can ask you a series of questions or provide a simulated scenario. Please let me know what type of stress test you'd like to simulate, and we can get started!"
