Physical stress test (e.g., endurance exercise)?\n2. Mental stress test (e.g., cognitive ability or emotional resilience)?\n3. Technical stress test (e.g., software or system performance)?\n\nPlease provide more context or clarify which type of stress test you'd like to simulate, and I'll do my best to assist you!"
