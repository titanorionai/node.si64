A physical fitness test, such as a military-style Physical Fitness Test (PFT)?\n2. A mental health or emotional resilience test?\n3. A financial stress test, evaluating your ability to manage debt and expenses?\n4. Something else entirely?\n\nPlease let me know, and I'll do my best to help you prepare for the test or provide guidance on how to perform it."
