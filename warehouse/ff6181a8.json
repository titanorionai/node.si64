Physical stress test, such as a cardio endurance test?\n3. A simulation stress test, like a video game or a complex system?\n\nPlease provide more context so I can better understand what you're looking for and assist you accordingly.\n\nIf you'd like to simulate a stress test, I can try to create a scenario for you. For example:\n\n* A math problem that requires quick calculations under time pressure\n* A logic puzzle with multiple steps and constraints\n* A text-based adventure game where you make decisions to progress through the story\n\nLet me know what kind of stress test you're looking for!"
