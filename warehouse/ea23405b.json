    "response": "I'll provide you with a stress test. Please note that this is not an official stress testing protocol, but rather a simulated test to help you assess your system's performance under various scenarios.\n\n**Stress Test #35:**\n\n**Test Objective:** Evaluate the system's performance when handling a large number of concurrent connections, simulations, and computations.\n\n**Test Parameters:**\n\n1. **Number of Concurrent Connections (NCC):** 100\n2. **Simulation Duration (SD):** 10 minutes\n3. **Computation Intensity (CI):** Medium-High\n4. **Data Size:** 100MB\n\n**Test Scenario:**\n\nYour system will be subjected to the following scenarios:\n\n1. **Concurrent Connections:** 100 connections will be established simultaneously, each performing a series of calculations and simulations.\n2. **Simulation Durations:** Each connection will perform its simulation for 10 minutes, with minimal pauses in between.\n3. **Computation Intensity:** The system will perform medium-high intensity computations throughout the test.\n4. **Data Size:** A large dataset (100MB) will be used for each calculation.\n\n**Test Output:**\n\nPlease provide your response in the format: \"Result: [insert result here]\" or \"Error: [insert error message here]\".\n\nNote: Since this is a simulated test, there won't be actual output. Please respond with a hypothetical outcome based on how you think your system would perform under these conditions."
