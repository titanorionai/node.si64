Here's a stress test for you:\n\n**Stress Test #10: Memory Game**\n\n**Objective:** To identify and remember as many numbers in a sequence as possible within a set time frame.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. I will give you a sequence of 20 numbers, and you need to write them down in the correct order.\n2. The twist is that every 5th number in the sequence will be a \"decoy\" - it's not part of the actual sequence, but might look similar to the surrounding numbers.\n3. You have 10 minutes to complete the task.\n\n**Sequence:**\n\n1, 2, 4, 8, ??, 16, 32, 5, 10, 20, 40, ??, 80, 12, 24, 48, ??, 96, 15, 30, 60\n\nGood luck! Remember to pay close attention to the decoy numbers and write down the actual sequence. When you think you're done, let me know and I'll tell you whether you got it right or not.\n\n**Go ahead and start writing down the sequence!**\n\n(Note: Please respond with your written-down sequence, and I'll provide feedback on its accuracy.)"
