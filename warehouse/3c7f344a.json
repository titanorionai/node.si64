Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Math Stress Test**: I'll give you a series of math problems that will require you to think quickly and make calculations under pressure.\n2. **Memory Game Stress Test**: We can play a game where I'll show you a sequence of numbers or words, and then ask you to recall the sequence in reverse order.\n3. **Language Stress Test**: I'll give you a series of words with a specific theme (e.g., countries, animals, food), and you have to come up with as many words as possible that fit the theme within a set time limit.\n\nWhich type of stress test would you like to undergo? Or do you have a different idea for a stress test?"
