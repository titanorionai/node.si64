Run a coding-related stress test, such as writing a program that solves a complex problem or performs a large-scale computation?\n2. Engage in a conversation and respond to a series of challenging questions on a particular topic?\n3. Try to identify an error in a piece of code or a logical flaw in an argument?\n\nPlease let me know which type of stress test you're looking for, and we can get started!"
