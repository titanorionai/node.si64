You've been faced with several challenges lately, including rising employee costs, increased competition from e-commerce giants, and a decline in foot traffic due to changing consumer behaviors.\n\nYour goal is to make decisions that will help your company recover and thrive in this dynamic environment. You have 30 minutes to make three key decisions:\n\n**Decision 1: Investment in Employee Benefits**\n\nA) Invest $100,000 in employee benefits, including health insurance and retirement plans, to attract and retain top talent.\nB) Cut back on employee benefits by $50,000 to reduce costs.\nC) Keep the current benefits package unchanged.\n\n**Decision 2: E-commerce Strategy**\n\nA) Launch an e-commerce platform to expand your online presence and reach new customers.\nB) Focus on improving in-store experiences and reducing online dependence.\nC) Shutter all physical stores and focus solely on e-commerce.\n\n**Decision 3: Store Expansion**\n\nA) Open a new store location in a high-traffic area to increase foot traffic and brand visibility.\nB) Close underperforming stores and redirect resources to more profitable locations.\nC) Expand into new markets through strategic partnerships with other retailers.\n\nPlease respond with the letter of your chosen decision for each question.
