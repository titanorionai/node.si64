For example:\n\n1. Is it a technical stress test (e.g., performance testing, load testing)?\n2. Is it a financial stress test (e.g., budgeting, investment analysis)?\n3. Is it an academic stress test (e.g., problem-solving, mental math)?\n\nPlease provide more context or clarify which type of stress test you're referring to, and I'll do my best to assist you!"
