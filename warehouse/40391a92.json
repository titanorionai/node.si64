However, I need to clarify that I'll be providing a simulation of a stress test, not an actual financial or emotional assessment.\n\nHere's Stress Test #4:\n\n**Test Type:** Emotional Stress Test\n\n**Instructions:** Imagine yourself in a high-pressure situation where you're facing multiple challenges simultaneously. Your goal is to remain calm and focused while making decisions under duress.\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nYou're the project manager of a large-scale software development company. You've been tasked with leading a team of developers who are working on a critical project deadline.
