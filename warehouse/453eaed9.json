Are you testing my language understanding, generation, or something else?\n\nIf you'd like, we can try one of the following:\n\n1. **Conversational Stress Test**: We'll have a conversation and see how well I respond under pressure.\n2. **Language Understanding Stress Test**: You'll provide me with a scenario or question, and I'll try to understand it correctly despite some level of ambiguity or complexity.\n3. **Generative Stress Test**: I'll provide you with a prompt, and you'll ask me to generate a response. We can then increase the difficulty by adding more constraints or requirements.\n\nWhich one sounds like fun?"
