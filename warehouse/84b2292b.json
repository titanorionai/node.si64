    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test! However, I don't have any specific information about what kind of stress test you're referring to. Could you please provide more context or clarify which type of stress test you'd like me to simulate?\n\nHere are some options:\n\n1. **Cognitive stress test**: I can try to engage in a conversation that requires attention, working memory, and processing speed.\n2. **Mathematical stress test**: We can perform calculations, such as mental math or solving equations, to challenge your numerical skills.\n3. **Memory stress test**: I can provide you with a series of words or phrases to remember, and then ask you to recall them.\n4. **Role-playing stress test**: We can engage in a role-playing scenario that simulates real-life situations, such as customer service or job interviews.\n\nLet me know which type of stress test you're interested in, and I'll do my best to simulate it!"
