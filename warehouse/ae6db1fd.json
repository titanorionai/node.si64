Since I don't have any specific information about what kind of stress test you're referring to, I'll provide a general example.\n\nStress Test #8: High-Load Calculator\n\n**Objective:** Write a Python function that calculates the future value of an investment based on its current value, interest rate, and number of years. The twist is that the user inputs the high-load values for the variables, which should trigger an error or unexpected behavior.\n\n**Function Definition:**\n\n```python\ndef calculate_future_value(current_value, interest_rate, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the future value of an investment based on its current value, \n    interest rate, and number of years.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    current_value (float): The current value of the investment.\n    interest_rate (float): The annual interest rate as a decimal.\n    years (int): The number of years for the investment to grow.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The future value of the investment.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n**Stress Test Inputs:**\n\n1. High-load inputs:\n\n```python\n# Extremely large numbers\ncurrent_value = 1000000000\ninterest_rate = 0.99999999\nyears = 10000000\n\n# Very high decimal precision\ncurrent_value = 1234567890123456789\ninterest_rate = 0.1234567890123456789\nyears = 9876543210987654321\n```\n\n2. Invalid inputs:\n\n```python\n# Non-numeric values for interest rate or years\ninterest_rate = 'hello'\nyears = 'world'\n\n# Negative interest rate\ninterest_rate = -0.99999999\n\n# Zero years\nyears = 0\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nThe function should handle the high-load inputs by returning a reasonable result, while also raising an error for invalid inputs.\n\n```python\nprint(calculate_future_value(current_value, interest_rate, years))\n```\n\nThis stress test assesses the function's ability to handle extreme values and unexpected input types. If the function can handle these scenarios correctly, it demonstrates good design and robustness."
