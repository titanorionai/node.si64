    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test, but I need to know what kind of stress test you're referring to. Are you talking about:\n\n1. A physical stress test (e.g., a cardiovascular stress test)?\n2. A software stress test (e.g., a performance testing scenario)?\n3. A financial stress test (e.g., an economic simulation)?\n\nPlease let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun mental exercise, I can also offer a hypothetical stress test:\n\n**Mental Stress Test**\n\nImagine you're in a situation where you need to make a critical decision with limited information. You have 30 minutes to come up with a plan, and you'll be evaluated on your creativity, problem-solving skills, and ability to think on your feet.\n\nYou start with a blank slate and a few basic resources. As the clock ticks away, you'll face increasingly challenging obstacles and need to adapt your strategy.\n\nReady to begin?"
