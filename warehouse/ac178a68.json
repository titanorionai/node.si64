Please note that this is just for fun and not meant to be taken seriously.\n\n**Stress Test #19: The Unexpected Challenge**\n\nYou wake up one morning to find that your favorite coffee shop has been transformed into a giant ball pit.

We've been training for this moment. You must navigate the ball pit, retrieve 10 coffee cups, and answer three trivia questions within 5 minutes. Failure will result in being trapped in an endless loop of elevator music.\"\n\nHere are your stats:\n\n* Energy: 100\n* Focus: 80\n* Trivia Knowledge: 60\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nA) Dive into the ball pit and start searching for coffee cups.\nB) Try to communicate with the barista to understand the rules better.\nC) Use your surroundings to gather information about the ball pit's layout.\n\nChoose your response:"
