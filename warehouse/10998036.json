Financial stress test (e.g., evaluating the impact of market fluctuations on investments)?\n2. Physical stress test (e.g., assessing the body's response to exercise or heat)?\n3. Software stress testing (e.g., identifying performance bottlenecks in an application)?\n4. Something else entirely?\n\nPlease provide more context, and I'll do my best to assist you with your stress test!"
