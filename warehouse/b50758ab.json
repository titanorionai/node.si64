    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test. What kind of stress test are you referring to? Are you looking for a technical stress test, such as a performance benchmarking exercise, or a more general stress test related to mental or emotional resilience?\n\nIf you're referring to a technical stress test, could you please provide more context or information about what you're trying to achieve? For example:\n\n* What system or application are you testing?\n* What kind of performance metrics are you interested in measuring (e.g. response time, throughput, resource utilization)?\n* Are there any specific tools or frameworks you'd like to use for the test?\n\nIf you're referring to a mental or emotional stress test, could you please let me know what kind of support you're looking for? For example:\n\n* Would you like some relaxation techniques or meditation exercises?\n* Are you looking for strategies to manage anxiety or overwhelm?\n* Would you like some general advice on how to prioritize self-care and stress management?\n\nLet me know and I'll do my best to help!"
