Is it a technical stress test, a financial one, or something else entirely?\n\nIf you're looking for a general stress test to assess your mental endurance, here's one:\n\n**Stress Test #17:**\n\nImagine you're stuck in an elevator for 30 minutes with no phone signal. The lights flicker, and the air conditioning doesn't work. You're hot, thirsty, and starting to feel anxious.\n\nAs the minutes tick by, think about ways to pass the time, stay calm, and conserve energy. Here are some stress test questions:\n\n1. What would you do to occupy yourself?\n2. How would you cope with the heat and thirst?\n3. Would you try to call for help or wait it out?\n\nTake a few minutes to answer these questions, and see how you handle this simulated stress situation!"
