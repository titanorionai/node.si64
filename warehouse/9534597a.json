    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test, but I need to know what type of stress test you are referring to. Are you looking for a:\n\n1. Physical stress test (e.g., endurance test)?\n2. Mental stress test (e.g., cognitive test)?\n3. Financial stress test (e.g., budgeting or investment analysis)?\n4. Something else entirely?\n\nPlease provide more context or clarify your question, and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nIf you're looking for a general physical exercise stress test, I can offer some suggestions:\n\n**Physical Stress Test:**\n\n* Warm up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio (jogging, jumping jacks, etc.)\n* Gradually increase intensity and duration over the next 20-30 minutes:\n\t+ Sprint intervals or high-intensity interval training (HIIT)\n\t+ Weightlifting or resistance exercises\n\t+ Cardiovascular exercises (e.g., cycling, rowing, or swimming)\n\nRemember to listen to your body, stay hydrated, and take regular breaks to avoid fatigue.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific questions or preferences regarding this type of stress test!"
