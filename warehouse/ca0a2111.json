A cognitive stress test (e.g., memory, attention, or processing speed)?\n2. An emotional stress test (e.g., anxiety, frustration, or fatigue)?\n3. A physical stress test (e.g., endurance, strength, or agility)?\n\nPlease let me know which type of stress test you're interested in, and I'll do my best to simulate a scenario to help you prepare or identify areas for improvement."
