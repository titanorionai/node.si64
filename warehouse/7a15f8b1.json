    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test! However, I don't see what specific type of stress test you're referring to (e.g. financial, mental, physical). Can you please provide more context or clarify which type of stress test you'd like me to simulate?\n\nIf you meant a stress test in the sense of a technical evaluation, I can try to simulate a short scenario. Please let me know what kind of system or application we should be testing.\n\nAlternatively, if you're looking for a mental or emotional stress test (e.g. a personality assessment), I'd need more information on what aspects of your mental or emotional well-being you'd like to evaluate.\n\nPlease provide more details so I can better understand and assist you!"
