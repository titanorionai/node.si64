    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test, but I need more information about what you're testing. Could you please provide more context or details about the system, application, or component you want to stress test? Additionally, what are the specific goals and objectives of this stress test?\n\nHere's an example of how we can structure this conversation:\n\n* What is the purpose of the stress test (e.g., performance evaluation, security testing, reliability assessment)?\n* What systems, applications, or components will be subjected to stress?\n* What types of stresses will be applied (e.g., load, traffic, concurrency, resource utilization)?\n* Are there any specific metrics or KPIs that need to be measured during the test?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your requirements, I can assist you in designing and executing a successful stress test."
