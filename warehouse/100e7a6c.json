    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test. However, I want to clarify what you mean by \"stress test.\" Are you referring to a:\n\n1. Technical stress test, where we simulate heavy loads or unusual usage patterns on a system, application, or infrastructure?\n2. Emotional or psychological stress test, where we assess your ability to manage and respond to challenging situations?\n\nPlease let me know which type of stress test you are referring to, and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nIf it's the first option (technical stress test), please provide more details about what you want to simulate or test. If it's the second option (emotional or psychological stress test), we can discuss general strategies for managing stress and building resilience."
