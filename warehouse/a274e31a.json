    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test. Here's a scenario for you:\n\n**Stress Test #25: \"Emergency Response\"**\n\nYou are the shift supervisor at a busy emergency medical services (EMS) dispatch center. The center is receiving an influx of calls, including multiple 911 emergencies, car accidents, and medical emergencies.\n\nYour team is short-staffed due to a sudden illness outbreak among the crew members, leaving you with only one other dispatcher available to assist you.\n\nAs the shift supervisor, your primary responsibility is to prioritize calls, allocate resources, and coordinate responses. The situation is critical, and every minute counts.\n\n**Simulate the Stress Test:**\n\nYou receive the following 5 emergency calls in rapid succession:\n\n1. **Call 1:** A 911 call from a witness of a multi-vehicle accident on the highway. The caller reports multiple vehicles involved, with at least one person injured.\n2. **Call 2:** A car accident reported by a driver who claims to have collided with another vehicle. The driver is injured and requesting assistance.\n3. **Call 3:** A medical emergency call from a hospital, where a patient has gone into cardiac arrest. The hospital staff are struggling to revive the patient.\n4. **Call 4:** A fire alarm triggered at a commercial building due to an electrical issue. The caller reports multiple people trapped inside.\n5. **Call 5:** A report of a domestic disturbance at a residential address, with multiple parties involved.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nPrioritize these emergency calls and allocate resources accordingly. You must decide which calls to dispatch first, and how many units (ambulances, fire trucks, police cars) to send.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* The closest ambulances are 10 minutes away from the scene of Call 1.\n* The car accident at Call 2 is located just a few blocks away from the dispatch center.\n* The hospital reported in Call 3 has a team of doctors and nurses on site, but they need assistance with stabilizing the patient.\n* The fire alarm at Call 4 requires a large response force to safely evacuate the building.\n* The domestic disturbance at Call 5 is located near a high school and may require police presence.\n\n**What Do You Do?**\n\nPlease respond with your prioritization of the emergency calls, allocating resources as needed."
