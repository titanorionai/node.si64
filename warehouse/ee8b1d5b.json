    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test! However, I need to know what type of stress test you're referring to. Are you looking for:\n\n1. A mental health stress test?\n2. A physical fitness stress test (e.g., running or endurance test)?\n3. A technical stress test (e.g., software or system testing)?\n\nPlease let me know, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful response.\n\nIf you're referring to a mental health stress test, here's an example:\n\n**Mental Health Stress Test**\n\nTake this 10-minute test to assess your resilience and coping skills. Please answer the questions honestly, and try to take breaks if needed.\n\n1. On a scale of 1-5, how stressed do you feel right now?\n2. What's the most significant source of stress in your life? (e.g., work, relationships, finances)\n3. How often do you experience anxiety or panic attacks?\n4. Have you tried any relaxation techniques (e.g., meditation, deep breathing) to manage stress? If so, what works best for you?\n5. How would you rate your self-care habits (1-5, where 1 is \"not at all\" and 5 is \"very much\")?\n\n**Please add more questions as needed**\n\nLet me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further assistance!"
