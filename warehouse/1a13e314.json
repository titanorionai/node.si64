A financial stress test (e.g., evaluating an investment portfolio or a company's financial resilience)?\n2. A physical fitness stress test (e.g., measuring an individual's endurance or tolerance for exercise)?\n3. A psychological stress test (e.g., assessing an individual's coping mechanisms or mental well-being)?\n4. Something else?\n\nPlease let me know, and I'll do my best to help!"
