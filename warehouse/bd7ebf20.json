    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test, but I need more information on what kind of stress test you're referring to. Are you looking for:\n\n1. A coding stress test where I provide a prompt or problem and you try to solve it?\n2. A memory or computational resource stress test where I simulate a heavy load to see how your system handles it?\n\nPlease let me know which type of stress test you're interested in, and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nIf you're looking for a coding challenge, I can provide a problem statement, and we can get started. If you're looking for a memory or computational resource test, I can simulate a load on your system using a simulated workload."
