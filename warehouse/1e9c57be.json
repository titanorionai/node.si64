    "response": "I'd be happy to help with your stress testing exercise. However, I need more context or information about what you're trying to test and what the objectives of the test are.\n\nCould you please provide more details about:\n\n1. What type of system or application is being tested?\n2. What is the goal of the stress test (e.g., identify performance bottlenecks, evaluate scalability, etc.)?\n3. Are there any specific parameters or inputs that need to be varied during the test?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your requirements, I'll do my best to assist you with designing and executing a realistic stress testing exercise."
