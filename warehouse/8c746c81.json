A physical stress test (e.g., endurance test) where you push yourself to your limits?\n2. A financial stress test (e.g., investment analysis)?\n3. A mental or emotional stress test (e.g., coping mechanism assessment)?\n4. Something else?\n\nPlease provide more context, and I'll do my best to help you with a stress test of some kind!"
