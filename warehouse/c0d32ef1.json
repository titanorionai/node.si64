Stress test for anxiety or mental health?\n2. A physical fitness stress test (e.g., a cardio or endurance test)?\n3. A software or cybersecurity stress test?\n4. Something else?\n\nPlease provide more context, and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun challenge, I can offer you a stress test with some trivia questions, word games, or logical puzzles. Just let me know!"
