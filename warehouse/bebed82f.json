    "response": "I'm happy to help with a stress test! However, I need to clarify that I'll be simulating a stress test scenario for our conversation. Please keep in mind that this is not an actual performance or security test.\n\nHere's your stress test:\n\n**Scenario:** You are the system administrator of a large e-commerce website. The website has 10,000 users online at the same time, and it's a peak shopping season with high traffic and sales.\n\n**Your Task:** I'll simulate various stressors and you have to respond as if you were the system administrator. Your goal is to keep the website running smoothly and maintain user satisfaction.\n\nHere are the stressors:\n\n1. **High Traffic**: The website receives 5,000 new visitors in the next 5 minutes.\n2. **Resource Intensive Tasks**: Users start performing resource-intensive tasks such as uploading large files and creating complex orders.\n3. **Database Overload**: The database starts to slow down due to a large number of concurrent requests.\n4. **Payment Processing Issues**: A significant portion of users are unable to complete their payments due to technical issues.\n\nWhat do you do first?\n\nA) Add more servers to handle the high traffic\nB) Optimize database queries to improve performance\nC) Investigate and resolve payment processing issues\nD) Implement caching to reduce load on the database\n\nPlease respond with your chosen action."
