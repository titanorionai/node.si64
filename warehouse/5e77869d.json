A coding stress test (e.g., writing code under timed conditions)?\n2. A cognitive stress test (e.g., evaluating mental endurance and focus)?\n3. A physical stress test (e.g., measuring cardiovascular response to exercise)?\n\nPlease let me know, or provide more context, so I can tailor the \"stress test\" to your needs!"
